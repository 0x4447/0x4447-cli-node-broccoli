# ðŸ¥¦ Broccoli

If you are a developer with a local Nginx setup like [ours](https://github.com/davidgatti/my-development-setup/tree/master/05_custom_domains), and like to give the sites that you work on a local domain name, then for sure you experienced the tedious work of creating a Nginx config file, copy it in the right place and restart Nginx to load the new configuration.

To stream line this process, we decided to make our life bit simpler by creating this small CLI to automate this process.

# How to Install

```
] sudo npm install -g @0x4447/broccoli
```

# How to Use

```
] sudo broccoli
```

# What to Expect

Follow the instructions on the screen. The app will do the following for you:

- Ask the right questions ;)
- Create a config file
- Save it in to the Nginx directory
- Restart Nginx

We hope you'll find this app useful, and don't forget to check the source code. We took the time to write simple to understand code, so you can extend or customize the app to fit your needs.

# Why This Name?

Why not? We had to call it something. And once you see it, you're not going to forget it. ðŸ˜ƒ
