# ðŸ¥¦ Broccoli

If you're a developer with a local Nginx setup for the purpose of delivering local web pages with custom local domain names to mimic a real world scenario, you've definitely experienced the tedious work involved in creating Nginx config files: copy and paste a template, change the new file, save the file, reload the Nginx configuration file, and restart the server.

In this day and age, doing this with dozens of micro servers is truly a pain.

We decided to streamline the process and make our lives a bit simpler by creating this small CLI that automates everything.

We hope you'll find Broccoli as useful as we do.

# How to install

```
] sudo npm install -g @0x4447/broccoli
```

# How to use

```
] sudo broccoli
```

# Where to get help

```
] broccoli -h
```

# What to expect

Follow the instructions on the screen. The app will do the following for you:

- Ask the right questions ;)
- Create a config file
- Save the config file to the Nginx directory
- Restart Nginx

We hope you'll find this app useful. Don't forget to check the source code. We took the time to write easy-to-understand code that allows you to extend or customize the app to fit your needs.

# Companion Software

This CLI tool also works well with the following software:

- [Hot Pepper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x4447/hotpepper): Set up SystemD as the process manager for your NodeJS server with one simple command.
