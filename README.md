# giNnx

If you are a developer with a local Nginx setup like [mine](https://github.com/davidgatti/my-development-setup/tree/master/05_custom_domains), and like to give the sites that you work on a local domain name, then for sure you experienced the tedious work of creating a Nginx config file, copy it in the right place and restart Nginx to load the new configuration.

To stream line this process, I decided to make my life bit simpler by creating this small CLI to automate this process.

Once installed globally you just run `ginnx`, and follow the instructions on the screen. The app will do the following for you:

- Ask the right questions ;)
- Create a config file
- Save it in to the Nginx directory
- Restart Nginx

I hope you'll find this app useful, and don't forget to check the source code. I took the time to write simple to understand code, so you can extend or customize the app to fit your needs.
